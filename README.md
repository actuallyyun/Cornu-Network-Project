This is a social network application with distribution code from the [CS50W course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/).

The project is build with ```Django/Python``` with ```HTML, CSS``` and ```Javascript``` and deployed with Heroku. 
For deployment, I changed the Django default database sqlite4 to Postgresql. Another major configuration was to serve static files with AWS S3.

The application has the following functions: 

1. Users can register and sign in 
2. Users can make posts, edit their posts
3. Users can follow and unfollow other users 
4. Users can like and unlike other users
